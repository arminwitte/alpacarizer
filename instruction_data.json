The industrial revolution, starting in the second half of the 18th century, was made possible by the increasing use of steam power with coal as the primary energy source. From an engineering perspective, the conversion of energy from one form to another is one of the main tasks. Energy is needed for electricity, heat, transportation, and the manufacturing of goods. In 2014, the supplied primary energy for the whole world was 13699 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) which amounts to 159319 TWh (International Energy Agency, 2016). Oil, coal, and natural gas, all of which are fossil fuels, made up more than 80% of all fuel shares (International Energy Agency, 2016). A total of 108043 TWhwas consumed in 2014, 29.4%ofwhich by industry and 28.3% by transportation. A share of 8.9% of the consumed primary energy was put to non-energy use, e.g. chemical products (International Energy Agency, 2017). The total generation of electricity and heat in power stations was 23816 TWh (International Energy Agency, 2016) and 3815 TWh, respectively (International Energy Agency, 2017). With losses of 32203 TWh, this leads to an overall efficiency for the conversion of primary energy to electricity and heat of 46.2 %.

CO2 plays amajor role in the greenhouse effect determining earth\u2019s surface temperature (Rodhe, 1990; Lacis et al., 2010). The anthropogenic greenhouse effect is caused to 60% by the man-made emission of CO2 (Rodhe, 1990). In the last 200 years, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere rose from about 280 1 1 Introduction parts per million (ppm) to over 400 ppm (Houghton and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2001). CO2 is besides water one of the main products of the combustion process and can only be reduced by increasing efficiency.
